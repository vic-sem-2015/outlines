#### Collective Memory, or Emily's Close Reading:
#####Emily's Selected Passage:
>“All this, you remember, happened in those dark ages when there were no Schools of Design, before schoolmasters were invariably men of scrupulous integrity, and before the clergy were all men of enlarged minds and varied culture. In those less favoured days, it is no fable that there were other clergymen besides Mr. Stelling who had narrow intellects and large wants, and whose income, by a logical confusion to which Fortune, being a female as well as blindfold, is peculiarly liable, was proportioned not to their wants but to their intellect ­­ with which income has clearly no inherent relation. The problem these gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their wants and their income; and since wants are not easily starved to death, the simpler method appeared to be ­­ to raise their income. There was but one way of doing this: any of those callings in which men are obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen: was it their fault if their only resource was to turn out very poor work at a high price?” p. 176­
.

>This passage is one of Eliot’s many philosophical tangents in T​he Mill and the Floss.​The narrator steps away from the story in order to speak directly to the reader. They imply that they share a collective memory with the reader, as shown by the use of the phrase “you remember.” Phrases like this are typically used only during these tangents. I would suggest that the narrator invokes a sort of philosophical or social collective memory, tying the lesson of the preceding passage to the reader. The notion of a collective memory creates a certain exclusivity among her readership. The reader will either share the narrator’s collective memory and understand her biting sarcasm and criticism, or they will be introduced her critiques for the first time and want to join the narrator’s circle. The tangent is addressed to those already “in the know” and those who want to share the collective memory.

What sorts of ideological projects might Eliot have for appealing to her readership’s common collective memory? Do we view this, as described in *The Natural History of German Life*, as a nostalgic appeal for a pastoral past? As a nation-building project? As a Sir Walter Scott-esque reflexivity that’s actually meant to show the similarities between past and present, or point to the moments when the continuity has been erased?
In what ways could we read *Mill on the Floss* as standing in for or providing collective memory, in addition to appealing to it as a setting?

#### The Intruding Narrator, or Sophie’s Close Reading
##### Sophie’s Selected Passage:
>But you have known Maggie a long while, and need to be told, not her characteristics, but her history, which is hardly to be predicted even from the completest knowledge of characteristics. For the tragedy of our lives is not created entirely for within. ‘Character’ - says Novalis, in one of his questionable aphorisms - ‘character is destiny.’ But not the whole of our destiny. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was speculative and irresolute, and we have a great tragedy in consequence. But if his father had lived to a good old age, and his uncle had died an early death, we can conceive Hamlet’s having married Ophelia and got through life with a reputation of sanity notwithstanding many soliloquies, and some moody sarcasms towards the fair daughter of Polonius, to say nothing of the fronts incivility to his father-in-law.
					
>Maggie’s destiny, then, is at present hidden, and we must wait for it to reveal itself like the course of an unmapped river: we only know that the river is full and rapid, and that for all rivers there is the same final home.”  (418)
.

>The narrator intervenes throughout the novel. For the most part, The Mill on the Floss has an omniscient, third person narrator. Ever now and again, however, the narratorial voice changes and a first person narrator addresses the readers of the novel directly [...] I am not sure if this is the narrator asserting her dominance and over the readers and affirming that, no matter what the readers may want, the narrator - and also, necessarily, the author - of the novel, is in complete control of the story.
.			
> This leads me to a discussion of the second partial paragraph [...] The narrator claims that Maggie’s destiny “is at present hidden” which is a bizarre claim to make given that the narrator is omniscient during the vast majority of the novel. The narrator also lumps herself in with the clueless readers when she claims that “we must wait for it to reveal itself life the course of an unmapped river.” This emphasizes yet again that the narrator of this section of the text is not the same as the novel’s more common omniscient third person narrator. 
.					
> I would like to end by drawing attention to the fact that the river makes an appearance in this passage. The river is constantly referred to throughout the novel. It serves as foreshadowing for the novel’s ending, but it also makes the novel much more poetic. Because the image of the river is repeatedly presented to the reader it quickly becomes one the novel’s most poignant motifs. The Mill on the Floss has many poetic elements. One of the most striking of these elements is the circular nature of the novel and in the way in which it very much ends where it began. The quotation on the title page “In their death they were not divided” reappears on Tom and Maggie’s tombstone and serves as the novel’s final sentence. The frequent reappearance of language referring to the power of the river also serves, in my mind, to make this novel much more poetic than a typical Victorian novel. 
					
+ What is Eliot's aim by narrating through these two, seemingly different narrators? 
+ What do we make of Eliot's use of foreshadowing in the novel? Is it, again, an example of the narrator's ultimate control over the story? How does the epigraph play into this (both on the title page and for the various chapters)?

#### “Embodied” Memory -- and Lack Thereof
> “such things as these are the mother-tongue of our imagination, the language that is laden with all the subtle inextricable associations, the fleeting hours of our childhood left behind them. Our delight in the sunshine on the deep-bladed grass today, might be no more than the faint perception of wearied souls, if it were not for the sunshine and the grass in the far-off years which still live in us, and transform our perception into love” (30)

> “we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over it, as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten years ago. Every one of those moments has left its trace, and lives in us still, but such traces have blent themselves irrevocably with the firmer texture of our youth and manhood [...] Is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood, not merely with a memory of what he did and what happened to him, of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers, but with an intimate penetration, a revived consciousness of what he felt then?” (50)

#### Truth and Reality Effects
#####Geoff’s seminar paper:
>In his essay “Rhetoric and Realism: Hyperbole in The Mill on the Floss,” Jonathan Arac suggests that Victorian realistic novelists were conscious of their inability to perfectly portray reality; likewise, Arac argues that these novelists aimed to highlight the truth of the world through setting up alternate truths in their novels which they subsequently deconstruct. 

.

> Mr. Tulliver acknowledges the discrepancies of language, that real things “have got so twisted” and “wrapped up” in “unreasonable words.” This fits into Arac’s framework of thinking about the complexity of the realist novel, as it is an example of a split between a “character’s norms and those of a world in which [they] live.” One of the incorrect implications of Mr. Tulliver’s thinking, of course, is that Tom’s education would necessarily allow him to be “even” with others who are educated

.

> Mr. Tulliver’s hopes are comical, of course, because he wants Tom to be able to understand the hidden meaning in language while also suggesting that the meaning of language can still be hidden from others— most likely lawyers, who would have an education comparable to Tom’s. There is a discrepancy even within Mr. Tulliver’s imagination of Tom’s education.

.

> It is astonishing what a different result one gets by changing the metaphor! Once call the brain an intellectual stomach, and one’s ingenious conception of the classics and geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to settle nothing [...] O Aristotle! [...] would you not have mingled your praise of metaphorical speech as a sign of high intelligence, with a lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows itself in speech without metaphor – that we can seldom declare what a thing is, except by saying that it is something else? (147; emphasis added) 

.

> What is the truth here? The only knowledge the narrator offers, it seems, is the knowledge that language—specifically metaphor—cannot accurately capture truth. I believe that Arac is correct in his appraisal of The Mill and the Floss; Eliot does not seem to be naively attempting to capture truth— rather, she is constructing “alternate” truths through character’s language which she proceeds to deconstruct. 

+ Do we believe that Arac’s argument applies to the other novels that we have read in this course; do these authors seem to be pointing to truth indirectly, or do they actually have faith in their ability to portray the real world as it is?

+ Eliot seems, in particular, to attack “theory” in *Mill on the Floss.* Do we notice as explicit attacks on other types of language or discourse? If so, what does it mean that one might be more self-consciously targeted than others?

+ How would we characterize the treatment of dialect (we may want to think about this in relationship to Deb’s criticism summary as well)? 
				
#####Deborah’s Criticism, or How We Read
> Freedgood and Schmitt define “language unread” as language that readers find “means what it says or stands outside our purview” (1). In other words, Freedgood and Schmitt argue that the denotative, literal, and technical categories into which readers brush certain literary language reflect how readers reduce “texts to predetermined sites of meaning or interpretive possibility” 

> They describe literary criticism as problematic because it reads selectively, valuing certain parts of the text over others, when, in fact, denotative, literal, and technical language can play a major role, “allowing us to look through or around it rather than at it,” (4). In a way, Freedgood and Schmitt seem to argue that the denotative, literal, and technical allow fiction/novels to be self-aware of limitations and serve as a means to allow the reader to realize this and perhaps address the limitations: “To read denotatively, technically, or literally is not to explicate… It is the reverse: to restore obscurity to the apparently clear, to stop language from working” (4). 

>The rest of the essay seems to paint novels as keenly aware products of time that use various (perhaps unobvious due to the way we have learned to read) ways to make this apparent to the reader. The nonfigural, often unread language, acts as space and pauses for the reader to make meaning/reference (9). This time and space, this slowing down of reading, Freedgood and Schmitt seem to argue, enriches/enables interpretation of such language. Having inquired into technical language, for instance, brings the reader back into thinking about it in relation to the language around it within the text

+ Considering this last excerpt from Deb’s paper: if technical/unread language serves as a point of reflection for 18th-century novel readers, does it really matter if literary criticism skips these “space and pauses” in their already reflexive study of novelistic language?

+ Raising the same question we explored in our first encounter with Freedgood: should critics be reading differently than novelists intended their readers--or Victorian readers--to actually read? (This might allow us to pause and have a quick conversation about why each of us likes to study literature, and what our goal in studying literature is)

#####The Natural History of German Life, George Eliot
> If we need a true conception of the popular character to guide our sympathies rightly, we need it equally to check our theories, and direct us in their application. The tendency created by the splendid conquests of modern generalization, to believe that all social questions are merged into economic science, and that the relations of men to their neighbors may be settled  by algebraic equations [...] none of these diverging mistakes can co-exist with a real knowledge of the People, with a thorough study of their habits, their ideas, their motives. The landholder, the clergyman, the mill-owner, the mining-agent, have each an opportunity for making precious observations on different sections of the working-class, but unfortunately their experience is too often not registered at all, or its results are too scattered to be available as a source of information and stimulus to the public mind generally. (55-56)

.

> “The unwillingness of the peasant to adopt innovations has a not unreasonable foundation in the fact, that for him experiments are practical, not theoretical, and must be made with expense of money instead of brains [...] The peasant has the smallest possible faith in theoretic knowledge; he thinks it rather dangerous that otherwise” (59-60)

.

> “The farmer’s lawsuit is his point of honour; and he will carry it through, though he knows from the very first day that he shall get nothing by it [...] To the mind of the peasant, law presents itself as the “custom of the country,” and it is his pride to be versed in all customs. *Custom with him holds the place of sentiment, of theory, and in many cases of affection.*” (61)

.

> Different valuations of history (60): While the peasants will respect that which pertains to them, they won’t respect remnants of the distant past: thus, what we see argued here is a different valuation assigned to distant and recent histories. Consider, also, from *Mill on the Floss*, Book 4 Chapter 1: “Journeying down the Rhone on a summer’s day, you have perhaps felt the sunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in certain parts of its course, telling how the swift river once rose, like an angry, destroying god, sweeping down the feeble generations whose breath is in their nostrils, and making their dwellings a desolation. Strange contrast, you may have thought, between the effect produced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace houses, which in their best days were but a sign of a sordid life, belonging in all its details to our own vulgar era; and the effect produced by those ruins on the castled Rhine which have crumbled and mellowed into such harmony with the green and rocky steeps, that they seem to have a natural fitness, like the mountain-pine …” 

.

> But what Eliot actually provides us with, in his discussion of the German peasantry, is a lumping tendency and an accompanying justification for his generalizations: “In the cultivated world each individual has his style of speaking and writing. But among the peasantry it is the race, the district, the province, that has its style; namely, its dialect, its phraseology, its proverbs and its songs, which belong alike to the entire body of the people. This provincial style of the peasant is again, like his physique, a remnant of history to which he clings with the utmost tenacity” (58); “But the generic character of the German peasant is everywhere the same” (68)

+ The danger of English novelists’ representations of peasant life is here described as inhibiting the reading public’s ability to know the true motivations of “the people.” What we find in the actual article isn’t so much a new experimental anthropology grounded in fact, however, as a newly applied theory -- explicitly for the purposes, it seems, of explaining the propensity of the peasants to take up political ideologies and “degenerate” from their more “noble” or “ignorant” lifestyles. 

+ In what ways does a utilitarian view of literature, such as that held by Eliot here and, perhaps, that of Charles Reade, dictate different commitments to reality and/or its representation? Can we really distinguish, as Freedgood and Schmitt do, between “technical” or “useful” language and the novel as a whole -- considering either novels holistically or specifically Victorian social reform novels? 

+ If, as seen in the first excerpt here and in Bahktin, we think of the novel as a systemic organizational project of discourses or experiences, is the novel itself a “theory”? Consider, From Book 4 Chapter 1: “we need not shrink away from this comparison of small things with great; for does not science tell us that its highest striving is after the ascertainment of a unity which shall bind the smallest things with the greatest? In natural science, I have understood, there is nothing petty to the mind that has a large vision of relations, and to which every single object suggests a vast sum of conditions. It is surely the same with the observation of human life.” 

####Eliot's Position in the Black Literary Tradition, or Transatlantic Eliot
Hack suggests that African American writers' embrace of Eliot is due to her novels "that emphasize racial identity, solidarity, and exclusivity," in contrast to Stowe's novels, which advocate for an interracial alliances:

>Ironically, though, it is precisely Eliot's departures from "the Negro novel" in *Daniel Deronda* and elsewhere that will resonate most with African American writers in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. That is, although invocations and adaptions of Eliot's work typically eschew the ultimate form this commitment takes in *Daniel Deronda*—the establishment of a separate homeland—-they tend to cluster nonetheless around aspects of Eliot's oeuvre that emphasize racial identity, solidarity, and exclusivity, including a plot Eliot pioneers that is not present in Stowe. (266)
			
Hack contends that African American writers who cited Eliot out of context were not necessarily ignorant; rather, these writers were demonstrating their knowledge of the dominant culture while also embracing literature that advocated for racial exclusivity:

>Yet it would be a mistake to read all citations of Eliot in African American literature and print culture as reflecting a lack of interest in or knowledge of the cited work as a whole, let alone unconcerned with the specificity of the passage quoted [...] in the majority of cases invocations of the poem serve not (only) to demonstrate the author's own cultural literacy but rather, or primarily, to advance a race-based agenda. If for Appiah, then, *Daniel Deronda* is the exemplary work of partial cosmopolitanism, for these African American writers, *The Spanish Gypsy* stands as the exemplary work of cosmopolitan partiality. (268)

Significantly, this seems to be opposed to Eliot's own views on the "race problem," as Hack quotes from *The Spanish Gypsey*:

>A woman, say, finds herself on the earth with an inherited organisation: she may be lame, she may inherit a disease, or what is tantamount to a disease: she may be a negress, or have other marks of race repulsive in the community where she is born [...] IT is almost a mockery to say to such human beings, "Seek your own happiness." The utmost approach to wellbeing that can be made in such a case is through large resignation and acceptance of the inevitable, with as much effort to overcome any disadvantage as good sense will show to be attended with a likelihood of success. (qtd. by Hack 271)		

As Hack notes, African American writers seldom reference Zarca's aspiration in *The Spanish Gypsey* to return to Africa:

>African American writers who  cite *The Spanish Gypsey* never explicitly address the African origins or destiny of the Zincali, nor do they quote the passages mentioning Africa. Williams may compare her club-women's ambitions to Zarca's, yet the idea of emigration to Africa goes against the grain of the project--and goes unmentioned. (271)

Finally, Hack argues that African American writers created their stories of "unwitting passing and discovered identity" through reading Eliot:

>For all the secrets of lineage revealed in Victorian novels, this particular plot of unwitting passage and discovered identity is extremely rare: while Eliot saw fit to use it twice, there are virtually no other well-known examples in all British literature. By contrast, a number of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American writers--most of them African American--constructed this same scenario, and did so almost invariably in stories about African American identity. 

>Although its greater prevalence in the United States suggests that this plot was more at home there, Eliot does not seem to have borrowed it from an American source. By contrast, several African American writers do seem to have had Eliot's versions of it in mind when they constructed their own. (272)

+ How does this specific story of novelistic reception inform a discussion on Freedgood and Schmitt, and how Victorian novels were read? 

+ Throughout *Mill on the Floss*, the narrator (one of Sophie’s two) comments on the distance between a classical or distant past and the recently experienced or remembered past. Thinking about how we study literature: what do we miss when we discuss reception and reading practices contemporary to the novel and in the present day, but skip over the genealogy of its reception? 

+ Can we relate this conversation to chapter epigraphs in *Mill of the Floss*?

+example visualiztion of novels + epigraphs http://earlynovels.org/?page_id=16

+ How much can we attribute this genre of unwitting passing and discovering identity to Eliot rather than Stowe?
