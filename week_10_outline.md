### Lady Audley’s Secret by Mary Elizabeth Braddon

#### Rachel on the Sensation Novel (please?) @1:15-1:30

#### Geoffrey’s Close Reading: Lady Audley’s Portrait @1:30-2:00
> The Pre-Raphealites http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/praf/hd_praf.htm 
> [W]e cannot be sure who is narrating this appraisal… the narrator refers to Lady Audley as “my lady,” which could both refer to the narrator claiming Lady Audley as his character or to George’s recognition that Lady Audley is in fact his wife… The narrator in Lady Audley’s Secret is, I argue, constrained in ways that are unique to the genre of the sensation novel.

> By the end of the story, the reader knows that this portrait is actually true to Lady Audley’s character— which makes the narrator’s frustration in this portrait important for our understanding of narration in L​ady Audley’s Secret.​

+ What, exactly, is the narrator frustrated about here? Are they frustrated with the portrait itself? Is the narrator frustrated because they cannot reveal the significance of this portrayal of Lady Audley?

> The omniscient narrator is limited in the sensation novel because the genre depends on the reader’s pursuit of knowledge alongside the character’s.

> The sensation genre thus necessitates that the reader finish the entire novel in order to fully grasp the truth of the work— a truth that needs to be revealed by a character’s own speech after she has been successfully unmasked by another character.

+ How does time work in regards to the narrator’s, reader’s, and character’s experiences? Who knows what evidence when? How can this shape our understanding of how a sensation novel functions?

+ Does the truth lie in the final conclusion, that is by reading the solution to the mystery? What kinds of truth are revealed here? Is there any truth in evidence like this, or does the truth come from creating a narrative supported by the evidence?

#### Modes of Narration @2:00-2:20
> quiet narrator: responsible for all the details in the text - i.e. those that are not explicitly commented on? what might be perceived as insignificant (re: Barthes’ reality effect)? a little more complicated, because the narrator becomes louder upon second look (after finishing the novel)

+ A glorious old place --- a place that visitors fell into raptures with; feeling a yearning wish to have done with life, and to stay there for ever, staring into the cool fish-ponds, and counting the bubbles as the roach and carp rose to the surface of the water --- a spot in which Peace seemed to have taken up her abode, setting her soothing hand on every tree and flower; on the still ponds and quiet alleys; the shady corners of the old-fashioned rooms; the deep window-seats  behind the painted glass; the low meadows and the stately avenues --- ay, even upon the stagnant well which, cool and sheltered as all else in the old place, hid itself away in a shrubbery behind the gardens, with an idle handle that was never turned, and a lazy rope so rotten that the pail had broken away from it, and had fallen into the water. (p. 8)

> suggestive narration: responsible for foreshadowing, framing the narrative as a mystery, 
creating something that is almost dramatic irony (p.52)

+ [T]here was an avenue called the lime-tree walk; an avenue so shaded from the sun and sky, so screened from observation by the thick shelter of the over-arching trees, that is seemed a chosen place for secret meetings of for stolen interviews… and yet it was scarcely twenty paces from the house (3). 

> So, how do we reconcile the two modes? And as Geoff points out, might the text itself depict a tension within, between the two modes of narration? Perhaps, even the narrator as a character (“my lady”) and a conveyer of the narrative? Why might this apparent tension be important? What is at stake in using the two modes? 
where the lines blur between the two modes? (George and Lady Audley’s stories about Helen’s father vary: Chapters )

> Alli seems to have some insight on what might be pressuring the narrator… i.e. time?

#### Alli’s Seminar Paper: Audley-an Architecture: The Agency of Accumulation in Lady Audley’s Secret @2:20-3:00

> Braddon has essentially written a story that claims that the actions of its main character are superfluous because he is merely an agent of a revealing forward progression towards retrospective truth.

+ In Volume II, Chapter IV, Robert visits Harcourt Talboys to see if George’s family cares enough about his disappearance for him to continue his investigation. How do these scenes related to Robert’s agency?

.
> As so much of Robert’s evidence depends on ephemeral documentation that seems only to have been preserved by its various owners by works of chance, readers are constantly confronted with the possibility that Robert’s chain will not be reconstructed – that a link will have been intentionally destroyed or gone missing, that history itself will have been opened to erasure.

+ What about evidence that was intentionally preserved, such as the locks of hair, George Jr.’s baby shoes, the letters George gave to Luke Marks, and the current newspaper articles? How can we connect characters’ motives in preserving evidence (which sometimes turns out to be harmful) to the fragility of the chain of evidence?

.
> In examining how various characters’ houses are described in Lady Audley’s Secret, I hope to unite a discussion of temporality with a discussion of locating meaning in things[1] – for as Lady Audley’s history is one told as much by the materiality of the documentary evidence Robert assembles against her, thingy-ness is also portrayed as an embodiment of personal histories themselves throughout the novel.  [1] I won’t be discussing textual things – documents, letters, etc. – but non-textual objects (although it would be interesting to try and extrapolate the argument in class, if others find it interesting/helpful).

.
> The former’s house is not only described as a manifestation of his character, but his character is constructed as his house, and one of the most distinctive characteristics of Lady Audley’s inner rooms is the peculiar placement of mirrors which replicate her own image throughout the chamber, literally multiplying and framing her subjectivity amongst collections of objects in which “every evidence of womanly refinement was visible (Braddon 250).

+ to link this back to time, what about the disarrayed architecture of the Court? an amalgamation of styles from different time periods?

> We can see these same anxieties underlying the detective process in Lady Audley’s Secret: objects subject to time, like Audley Court, become subject additionally to monstrous transformation, whereas those that seem to stand beyond it are revealed as dead, mad or unreal. Within this construction, the realist object becomes a receptacle for the markings of time, rather than as reflections of a particular subjectivity: indeed, those objects that serve to paint too complete a reflective picture, like the mirrors of Lady Audley’s court, are not to be trusted in what they ostensibly seem to reveal. Meaning thus comes not only to be read suspiciously into every object, as readers are invited to play amateur detectives: readers are also trained to read which meanings are organically rendered and which are commercially constructed through consumerism – a critical reading strategy that would discursively have consequences for the experience of reading ephemeral sensationalist fiction as well. 

+ Lady Audley’s remarks on the French story of the beautiful woman who had committed a crime (105-6)

> With the characters residing outside of time and history at the end of the novel, the concept of “resolution” is made ambiguous. Because to live within time is to be subject to its agency, as Robert demonstrates in his detective work, the only way to preserve a lasting peace without decay is to remove oneself completely from its stream; however, this is also signaled as unreal, a literary convention – explicitly, even, in the final paragraph.

+ Why is the resolution ambiguous? Is it ambiguous because of the lack of precise description?
+ How can we connect Lady Audley’s fate to the idea of “preserv[ing] a lasting peace” by “remov[ing] oneself completely from its stream”?

> If the “truth” found in Lady Audley’s total revealed history matches the truth that we intuit before Robert’s chain of evidence is constructed – or the truth that can be found in the objects that Robert recovers without constructing the entire chain – then we are forced to reconsider the “stagnant” fragment in perhaps a different light: as reflective of a moment that can nonetheless tell a larger story without being placed back into context.

+ Are we, as readers, compelled to finish the story to see if Robert can accumulate enough evidence to convict Lady Audley or convince people (like her husband) who will try their hardest to remain unconvinced?
+ Did we, as readers, believe Lady Audley had committed worse or different crimes than we had originally thought? What do the twists in this regard mean?
+ Looking at the evidence altogether, excluding Lady Audley’s confession and the damning letters at the end, what crimes can Robert really prove if the reader ignores their intuition? What effect does the concluding evidence really have on the investigation?

#### Thoughts on Narration, Truth-Telling, and Preserving the Peace

> We hear every day of murders committed in the country. Brutal and treacherous murders; slow, protracted agonies from poisons administered by some kindred hand; sudden and violent deaths by cruel blows, inflicted with a stake cut from some spreading oak, whose very shadow promised --- peace. In the country of which I write, I have been shown a meadow in which, on a quiet summer Sunday evening, a young farmer murdered the girl who had loved and trusted him; and yet even now, with the stain of what foul deed upon it, the aspect of the spot is --- peace. No crime has ever been committed in the worst rookeries about Seven Dials that has not been also done in the face of that sweet rustic calm which still, in spite of all, we look on with a tender, half-mournful yearning, and associate with --- peace. p. 51

> Two years have passed since the May twilight in which Robert found his old friend; and Mr. Audley’s dream of a fairy cottage had been realized between Teddington Lock and Hampton Bridge, where, amid a little forest of foliage, there is a fantastical dwelling-place of rustic woodwork, whose latticed windows look out upon the river. Here amongst the lilies and the rushes on the sloping bank, a brave boy of eight years old plays with a toddling baby who peeps wonderingly from its nurse’s arms at that other baby in the purple depth of the quiet water. p. 378

> It is more than a year since the black-edged letter, written upon foreign paper, came to Robert Audley, to announce the death of a certain Madame Taylor, who had expired peacefully at Villebrumeuse, dying after a long illness, which Monsieur Val describes as a maladie de langueur. p. 379

> Audley Court is shut up, and a grim old housekeeper reigns paramount in the mansion which my lady’s ringing laughter once made musical. A curtain hangs before the pre-Raphaelite portrait: and the blue mould which artists dread gathers upon the Wouvermans and Poussins, the Cuyps and Tintorettis. The house is often shown to inquisitive visitors, though the baronet is not informed of that fact, and people admire my lady’s rooms, and ask many questions about the pretty, fair-haired woman who died abroad. p. 379

+ Do we see themes of erasure in these scenes, or is the pastoral setting covering up something more malicious? Alli talks about a sense of timelessness in her seminar paper. What does this mean, exactly? The novel identifies that time has passed, but these passages suggest a return to the image of the countryside or an image of a pastoral that existed before. Evidence of past wrongs has decayed. Does this suggest, however, that Lady Audley’s crimes have not truly been erased or forgotten, given the earlier passage comments on the evil resting beneath the countryside’s pastoral image? What does it mean that people are still asking questions about Lady Audley’s disappearance, but that these questions go unanswered?
+ If these details are contributing to an illusion of peace, can we really call them insignificant? Are they insignificantly significant?

#### Sophie’s Criticism Summary: “Stop, Words” by Daniel Rosenberg @3:15-3:45

> Stop lists are collections of words that computers have been told not to look for
when a program is searching a document. They are also, according to Rosenberg, “a distillation
of what is simultaneously most common and least telling in the language, what the French writer
Georges Perec called the infraordinary.” (85)

> In any case, all of this was predicated on the presumption that the important things one wished to discern from language could be established without syntax, context, or style, by accounting only for significant words or later key words and finally keywords.” (85) This statement could not help but make me think of our class discussions concerning Barthes’ “reality-effect” and the difficulty of determining what is or is not significant.

+ In some cases of omitting, for example, articles from syntax, we are able to assume/the context implies what is missing; how might that be similar for the reading of the novel? The jumps we make in terms of what is implied by details, both in the realm of Barthes’ reality effect and the clues/evidence Robert collects (119: Robert on “circumstantial evidence”)? Do articles and prepositions in syntax achieve a degree of conclusiveness that details in the novel cannot?*

+ How does this function in the sensation or detective novel, where sometimes incorrect information is implied? How can we see Barthes’s reality effect working in this novel, where details that appear insignificant at first become major clues or, upon a second reading, seems to hint at the ultimate conclusion? (i.e. Sophie’s significant and insignificant changing)

#### Emily’s Criticism Summary: “Googling the Victorians” by Patrick Leary @3:45-4:00
> In addition to the increased speed of the research process, the “very randomness with which much online material has been placed there, and the undiscriminating quality of the search procedure itself” allows scholars to stumble across potentially helpful material that they would not have discovered had they undertaken “more focused research” by hand (p. 5). This material includes previously undiscovered information as scholars begin virtually connecting with “family historians” who want to make information about their ancestors publicly available (p. 14-5).

> Leary does, however, point out a significant drawback to the wide variety of information available online, noting that many online resources have not “been made available for specifically scholarly purposes or prepared to rigorous standards of scholarly care” (p. 5). As such, caution should be taken when relying on such resources.
+ Some of Robert’s evidence turns out to be misleading (i.e. the notice of Helen Talboys’s death), but ultimately proves to be valuable evidence of her falsehood. Does this parallel information Leary discusses, in which some information is useful but not scholarly vetted, or useful in non-traditional ways? 

> Leary may be suggesting that scholars will find unexpected materials but only unexpected materials that relate to the specific topic they searched for. He compares this effect to the (typical) reader of a scholarly publication who “mine[s] the text for interesting and useful data and argument” instead of reading it in its entirety (p. 10). He suggests that because reading is, to some extent, already fragmented and focused, it will not disrupt scholarly innovation. Instead, he says that the increase in efficiency and the increased availability of research materials and search results will “lend new urgency to arguments about what constitutes evidence of literary or intellectual influence” (p. 10).

+ In many instances, we see only a fragment of Robert’s research, such as a newspaper clipping or his list of evidence. In what ways can we use Leary’s recommendations and critiques to understand our experience of reading Robert’s evidence?

#### Robert’s Research @4:00-4:20
> JOURNAL OF FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF GEORGE TALBOYS, INCLUSIVE OF FACTS WHICH HAVE NO APPARENT RELATION TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

> 1. I write to Alicia, proposing to take George down to the Court.
> 2. Alicia writes, objecting to the visit on the part of Lady Audley.
> 3. We go to Essex in spite of this objection. I see my lady. My lady refuses to be introduced to George that particular evening on the score of fatigue.
> 4. Sir Michael invites George and me to dinner for the following evening.
> 5. My lady receives a telegraphic despatch the next morning which summons her to London.
> 6. Alicia shows me a letter from my lady, in which she requests to be told when I and my friend, Mr. Talboys, mean to leave Essex. To this letter is subjoined a postscript reiterating the above request.
> 7. We call at the Court, and ask to see the house. My lady’s apartments are locked.
> 8. We get at the aforesaid apartments by means of a secret passage, the existence of which is unknown to my lady. In one of the rooms we find her portrait.
> 9. George is frightened at the storm. His conduct is exceedingly strange for the rest of the evening.
> 10. George quite himself again the following morning. I propose leaving Audley Court immediately; he prefers remaining until the evening.
> 11. We go out fishing. George leaves me to go to the Court.
> 12. The last positive information I can obtain of him in Essex is at the Court, where the servant says he thinks Mr. Talboys told him he would go and look for my lady in the grounds.
> 13. I receive information about him at the station which may, or may not, be correct.
> 14. I hear of him positively once more at Southampton, where, according to his father-in-law, he had been for an hour on the previous night.
> 15. The telegraphic message.
+ Do the “facts which have no apparent relation to that circumstance” have significance here? Do they have significance (before we realize how they fit into the mystery) because they are included on the list?
