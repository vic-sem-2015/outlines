###Presentation of Criticism Summaries
> We’d like to think about the relevance of our critical readings not
> only for Reade’s project and methodology, but also for Hard Cash as a
> novel. (And a follow-up question: what are the affordances and dangers
> of thinking of a literary work as thematizing the conditions or
> practices of its production?)

#### Wheatley, “What Is An Index?”
>”The various matters treated of in the previous pages, go to prove the
>existence of a revived interest in the value of Indexes, and seem
>naturally to lead up to a notice of the formation of the Index
>Society.” (page 36)
.
>Report written by Mr. Robert Harrison in the Athenæum in 1877: “Could
>not a permanent INdex Society be founded with the support of voluntary
>contributions of money as well as of subject matter? In this way a
>regular staff could be set to work, under competent direction, and
>could be kept steadily at work until its performances became so
>generally known and so useful as to enable it to stand alone and be
>self-supporting. Many readers would readily jot down the name of any
>new subject they meet with in the book before them, and the page on
>which it occurs, and forward their notes to be sorted and arranged by
>any Society that would undertake the work.” (page 38)
.
>”The object of the General Index is just this, that anything, however
>disconnected, can be placed there, and much that would otherwise be
>lost will there find a resting place. Always growing and never
>pretending to be complete, the Index will be useful to all, and its
>consulters will be sure to find something worth their trouble of not
>all they may require.” (page 40)
>
#### Vannevar Bush, “As We May Think” - Sophie’s criticism summary
>After cataloguing only some of the various ways in which scientists and
>their research have benefited mankind, Bush presents his readers with
>one of the problems derived from this vast amount of knowledge.
.
>“It is strange that the inventors of universal languages have not
>seized upon the idea of producing one which better fitted the technique
>of transmitting and recording speech. Mechanization may yet for the
>issue, especially in the scientific field; whereupon scientific jargon
>would become still less intelligible to the layman.” (Section 3, page
>6) This reminded me of our discussion concerning the jargon of the
>doctors’ and its effect in Hard Cash.
.
>In the sixth section Bush explains the need for an entirely new system
>of indexing. The human mind “operates by association” very efficiently
>and so Bush hopes that “selection by association, rather than indexing,
>may yet be mechanized.” (Section 6, page 10) It is at this point that
>he describes the “memex”, “a future device for individual use, which is
>a sort of mechanized private file and library.” (Section 9, page 10) 
.
>Bush continues his description of the attributes of the “memex” in
>section seven. He states: “It affords an immediate step, however, to
>associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby
>any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically
>another. This is the essential feature of the memex.” (Section 7, page
>11) Another important feature of the “memex” is that it is more
>permanent than human memory. 
.
>This article also made me really think about the ways in which the
>Internet affects indexing, both positively and negatively, because Bush
>could not even conceive of information in such a large quantity and
>shared as easily as now exists thanks to the Internet.
>
#### Ronald Day, “Indexing It All” - Geoff’s criticism summary
>“The development of these information systems, Day argues, has led to
>the increasing representation of texts and people as information
>objects and data points. Day focuses on five cases to race the
>development of the modern documentary tradition: European
>Documentation, citation analysis, social computing, android robotics,
>and social big data. By highlighting and explaining the transition from
>one historical case to another, Day attempts to describe the increasing
>subsumption of the self into a documentary object.”
.
>Passage from Otlet’s 1903 publication “The Science of Bibliography and
>Documentation” Once, one read; today one refers to, checks through,
>skims. Vita brevis ars longa! There is too much to read; the times are
>wrong; the trend is no longer slavishly to follow the author through
>the maze of a personal plan which he has outlined for himself and
>which, in vain, he attempts to impose on those who read him.
Works are referred to, that is to say, one turns to them to ask for a
reply to very precise, specialized questions. The reply found, one parts
company, ungratefully no doubt but certainly for a thousand good
reasons, from the obliging friend who has just given such good service.
(568) .
>“Day then goes on to describe how the user, in order to meet their
>“information needs,” must relate those needs in the language of the
>information system they are using, in order to have success (maybe
>there is a way we can apply heteroglossia to this framework?).”
.
>“In the next section Day goes on to explain how the creation of
>citation indexing systems (a modern example being Google Scholar) has
>contributed to the transformation of the self into information that is
>ranked and indexed.”
Think about *Terrible Temptations* and the painting of Reade in his
study that we looked at. .
>“What I think would be particularly productive for our seminar is to
>discuss Otlet’s passage in Day’s text, as it relates to the rise of
>skimming and referencing rather than close reading. Also interesting
>for us, I think, is Day’s argument that users must frame their
>information needs in the language of the information system, as this
>argument is definitely related to our various discussions of language
>in Hard Cash.”
What is Day’s core argument about changes in systems of indexing and
their relationship to subject formation? What is the feeling of his
argument? Do we agree?

#### Foucault, “Classifying” from The Order of Things
> Foucault’s project is essentially to intervene in the history of
> science to show how the conception of “natural history” in the
> Enlightenment - Victorian era was understood as a linguistic
> classification project: natural history was the attempt to render
> language systemic, universal, and close to Nature itself. 
.
> Prior to the period in which Natural History arose, “History was the
> inextricable and completely unitary fabric of all that was visible of
> things and the signs that had been discovered or lodged in them: to
> write the history of a plant or an animal was as much a matter of
> describing its elements or organs as of describing the resemblances
> that could be found in it, the virtues that it was thought to possess,
> the legends and stories with which it had been involved [...]” (129).
> The historian’s work was to “establish the great compilation of
> documents and signs -- of everything, throughout the world, that might
> form a mark, as it were. It was the historian’s responsibility to
> restore to language all the words that had been buried” (130-131). We
> can almost think of the historian as a cataloguer of the discourses
> that Bahktin argues attach themselves to objects [is this clear or
> should I insert quote?] With Natural History, however, the historian’s
> task becomes examining the things themselves, rather than the
> documents, texts and names associated with things, and “transcribing
> what it has gathered in smooth, neutralized, and faithful words”
> (131). Natural History must “bring language as close as possible to
> the observing gaze, and the things observed as close as possible to
> the words. [It] is nothing more than the nomination of the visible”
> (132) [potential “in” to Deb’s paper].
.
> The perceived accuracy of language, according to Foucault, depended on
> universal application and recognition: “confronted with the same
> individual entity, everyone will be able to give the same description;
> and, inversely, given such a description everyone will be able to
> recognize the individual entities that correspond to it. In this
> fundamental articulation of the visible, the first confrontation of
> language and things can now be established in a manner that excludes
> all uncertainty” (134) It also depended on reprogramming how one
> observes and sees: “To observe, then, is to be content with seeing --
> with seeing a few things systematically” (134). The things that one
> “sees” are values pertaining to structure, or “the composition and
> arrangement” of the parts that make up a body. 
.
> When applying a name, or determining character, Foucault distinguishes
> between a systematic and methodological approach. The system is
> compared to the trial-and-error method in mathematics: it’s arbitrary
> insofar as cataloguers or classifiers select a few characteristics
> that will be compared and contrasted in determining relation between
> organisms. The method produces “a general table of relations” by
> delineating characteristics of every organism insofar as they differ
> from characteristics already found in previous organisms. The
> difference emphasized is that the system cannot be altered, once in
> place, whereas the method can be modified, as it works with variables
> rather than absolutes (140-144). Furthermore, when Foucault gets into
> continuity, he suggests that systems produce continuity through
> juxtaposition, whereas methods produce continuity through division:
> systems classify on a blank space, whereas methods proceed to “break
> down” and individuate a greater natural “fabric”, or order.

#### How does Reade’s organizing system in the novel relate to both the
#### criticism summaries, the story’s temporality/chronology, and/or
#### Reade’s methodology? 
#### 
> From *Hard Cash*: Chapter XV: Chronology -- The Hard Cash sailed from
> Canton months before the boat race at Henley recorded in Chapter I,
> but it landed in Barkington a fortnight after the last home event I
> recorded in its true series. Now this fortnight, as it happens, was
> fruitful of incidents, and must be dealt with at once. After that,
> “Love” and “Cash”, the converging branches of this story, will flow
> together in one stream.
> 
> Chapter XLVIII: I remember seeing it objected by novelists, by a young
> gentleman just putting his foot for the first time in “Criticism,”
> that the writers aforesaid suppress the small intermediate matters
> which in real life come by the score between each brilliant event: and
> so present the ordinary and extraordinary parts of life in false
> proportion. Now, if this remark had been offered by way of contrast
> between events themselves and all mortal attempts to reproduce them
> upon paper or the stage, it would have been philosophical; but it was
> a strange error to denounce the practice as distinctive in fiction
> [...] The truth is, that epics, dramas, novels, histories, chronicles,
> reports of trials at law, in a word, all narratives true or
> fictitious, except those which, real or fictitious, nobody reads,
> abridge the uninteresting facts as Nature never did, and dwell as
> Nature never did on the interesting ones. [...] I throw myself on the
> intelligence of my readers; and ask them to realise, that henceforth
> pages are no strict measure of time, and that to a year big with
> strange events, on which I have therefore dilated in this story,
> succeeded a year in which few brilliant things happened to the
> personages of this tale: in short, a year to be skimmed by the
> chronicler or novelist, and yet (mind you) a year of three hundred and
> sixty-five days six hours, or thereabouts, and one in which the quiet,
> unobtrusive troubles of our friends’ hearts, especially the female
> hearts, their doubts, diversions, distresses, did not remit -- far
> from it. Now this year I propose to divide into topics, and go by
> logical, rather than natural, sequence of events. 
> 
> Consider also, from Foucault: In his discussion on natural history,
> Foucault describes two conceptions of the interaction between a
> spatial/structural taxonomy of animals, which can be expressed in
> charts, or trees, or juxtaposed linearly, with a forward-moving line
> of time. In both models, time is subordinate to the taxonomic chart:
> “the sequence of time can never be anything but the line along which
> all possible values of the pre-established variables succeed one
> another” (153). The first model maintains the layout of the taxonomy,
> but allows it to be shifted in its entirety by time: “in the sense
> that all the points of the taxonomy are affected by a temporal index,
> with the result that ‘evolution’ is nothing more than the
> interdependent and general displacement of the whole scale from the
> first of its elements to the last” (151). The second model uses the
> various “marks” of the taxonomy to actually locate the action of time:
> time is believed to create more complexity and development in
> pre-existing species, thus advancing forward in taxonomy;s hierarchy:
> “the partial identities or resemblances that make taxinomia possible
> would then be the marks, revealed in the present, of one and the same
> living being, persisting through all the upheavals of nature and
> thereby filling all the vacant possibilities offered by the taxonomic
> table” (153).

#### Of the classification projects we’re presented in the critical
#### readings, which seems most helpful in thinking about Reade’s
#### methodology and Hard Cash as a novel? Can we map any of the systems
#### onto Sampson, Drs. Short/Osmond, Alfred, the lawyers, Fullalove,
#### and how they arrive at truth? How about Edward’s Indexing the
#### ‘Tiser? 
.
> From Hard Cash: “He took me into his studio -- it is carpeted with
> shavings -- and showed me the ‘Tiser digest, an enormous book he has
> made of newspaper cuttings all in apple-pie order; and out of this
> authority he proved vice and poverty abound most wherever there are
> more charities.”
> 
####Question about the different aims and goals of these classification
####and indexing projects; how are they similar? How different? If we
####think of Wheatley vs Otlet and Bush, can we identify core
####differences - between perhaps indexing as creating an extensible
####knowledge network vs a 20th c sense of a total knowledge project? 
####
#### Deb’s close reading
Mr. Hardie coloured, but did not reply. He had passed from the irritable
into the quietly vindictive stage. Alfred then deprecated further
discussion of what was past, and said abruptly, "I have an offer to make
you: in a very short time I shall have ten thousand pounds; I will not
resign my whole fortune; that would be unjust to myself, and my wife;
and I loathe and despise Injustice in all its forms, however romantic or
plausible. But, if you will give the Dodds their L. 14,000, I will share
my little fortune equally with you: and thank you, and bless you.
Consider, sir, with your abilities and experience five thousand pounds
may yet be the nucleus of a fortune; a fortune built on an honourable
foundation. I know you will thrive with my five thousand pounds ten
times more than with their fourteen thousand; and enjoy the blessing of
blessings, a clear conscience." Now this offer was no sooner made than
Mr. Hardie shut his face, and went to mental arithmetic, like one doing
a sum behind a thick door. He would have taken ten thousand: but five
thousand did not much tempt him: besides, would it be five thousand
clear? He already owed Alfred two thousand five hundred. It flashed
through him that a young man who loathed and despised Injustice—even to
himself—would not consent to be diddled by him out of one sum while
making him a present of another: and then there was Skinner's thousand
to be reimbursed. He therefore declined in these terms: "This offer
shows me you are sincere in these strange notions you have taken up. I
am sorry for it: it looks like insanity. These nocturnal illusions,
these imaginary sights and sounds, come of brooding on a single idea,
and often usher in a calamity one trembles to think of. You have made me
a proposal: I make you one: take a couple of hundred pounds (I'll get it
from your trustees) and travel the Continent for four months; enlarge
and amuse your mind with the contemplation of nature and manners and
customs; and if that does not clear this phantom L. 14,000 out of your
head, I am much mistaken." (Hard Cash, Chapter XXV) .
>“Although “stage” here refers to a “level,” “mode,” or “state” (of
>insanity), it also seems ironically appropriate in referring to
>performance, for Mr. Hardie soon draws a divide between his inner
>thoughts and his outward presentation.”
.
>“Because the narrator originally describes Mr. Hardie entering a
>computational mode, the reader may be inclined to see his thoughts as
>purely arithmetic; in fact, his vindictiveness is hidden in plain sight
>for he thinks of Alfred not as his son, but as a “young man” and
>considers Alfred in Alfred’s exact words, someone who “loathe[s] and
>despise[s] Injustice” (i.e. note the repetition of Alfred’s words)
>rather than someone who also wishes to give his father an opportunity
>to come clean.”
.
>“At the end of Mr. Hardie’s mental arithmetic, the narrator presents
>“He therefore declined in these terms” with such irony; although “these
>terms” refer to the subsequent quotation, the terms to follow in no way
>resemble the terms he was offered and had contemplated, also making the
>“therefore” ironic. The logic does not pan out, in the same way the
>reader should be suspicious of the space “behind a thick door”; in
>other words, Mr. Hardie’s own thoughts are not to be trusted.”
.
>“Thus, Mr. Hardie is not insane simply because he can so coolly use
>mental arithmetic to weigh his options regarding his own son, but
>because he truly believes that is all he is doing and that what he is
>doing can account for all. Mr. Hardie’s escape into himself resembles a
>form of containment, and such an escape into “logic” becomes dangerous.”
.
>“Finally, I am interested in discussing in what ways the narrator might
>be sympathetic, if at all, and how else we can translate the arithmetic
>thoughts of Mr. Hardie. In what ways can we consider insanity a form of
>aversion?”

#### Emily’s seminar paper : “Defining Sanity Through Classification and
#### “Incorporated Genres” in Hard Cash”
#### 
>“This paper will consider how Reade’s incorporation of different
>stylistic forms and their associated languages work to undermine the
>dominant medical discourse he represents in the novel. This paper will
>look at how language enables the doctors to create a shaky but
>authoritative classification system for mental illness and how Reade's
>use of extraliterary nonfictional forms, in this case legal and
>journalistic discourses, function as truth­telling tools.”
.
>“The doctors define insanity systematically, according to Foucault's
>definition, which allows them to create an arbitrary taxonomy that
>enforces their prejudices. Foucault says that a system operates by
>“selecting a finite and relatively limited group of characteristics,
>whose variations and constants may be studied in any individual entity
>that presents itself” (p. 139)”
.
>“The doctors’ taxonomy is too inconsistent to ensure a single correct
>diagnosis for Julia. However, the characters are unable to perceive the
>flaws in this system because of the medical jargon which they perceive
>as authoritative and incomprehensible. [...] Inconsistencies that could
>serve to undermine the accuracy of the doctors’ work is masked by the
>larger context of the incomprehensibility of medical language.”
.
>“Even though there had been no exhibition of insane behavior, the
>doctor is able to classify Alfred's ongoing internal mental state with
>little evidence of his current condition and no evidence of his past
>conditions. His status and language give him the authority to make
>these broad claims.”
.
>“Alfred seeks legal redress for this unfounded classification and his
>subsequent committal, but this process exposes the limitations of the
>law in regards to the actions it permits and prevents and the extent to
>which the law is a truth­seeking tool. [...] Reade incorporates an
>account of the legal process as a truth­seeking mechanism, allowing
>Alfred to attempt to externalize and prove his true history of mind.”
.
>“Reade inserts “real” nonfiction styles into his work which are meant
>to incorporates truths present in the real world, lending credibility
>to the “history of the mind”. Bakhtin refers to this choice as
>“incorporating genres”.”
.
>“This truth undermines languages which appear to be more constructed,
>such as medical discourse. Reade uses these forms to establish a true
>mental history for his characters, as well as for himself, by
>externalizing his mental accumulation of facts and forms through the
>use of notetaking, which were then incorporated into his novel.”
.
>“The implication of using the court transcript format is to suggest
>that the incomprehensibility of psychological jargon and the ills it
>conceals have already been “subdued” in the “extraliterary” legal world
>that the reader resides in. [...] The transcript format implies
>transparency, as it becomes part of a public record. Court transcripts
>are meant to expose the truth, not protect the “dignity” of those
>involved in the case. It is externalizing what the form suggests to be
>a true idea of Alfred's mental history.”
.
>“Additionally, while the trial ultimately deconstructs the doctors'
>classification of insanity, the law itself is deeply based in their
>flawed understanding of this mental state. Prior to trial, the doctors'
>opinions are considered legally correct, which is why it is impossible
>for Alfred to sue the doctors or the proprietors of the asylums.
>Alfred's “history of mind”, here, focuses on a single issue, rather
>than following a natural trajectory. While the trial helps to restore
>Alfred's reputation and allows him to tell part of his story, this is
>an incomplete telling. I would suggest that Reade completes his telling
>of “the history of mind” through another extraliterary form ­­­ the
>incorporation of facts and figures which can be seen as a precursor to
>the genre of investigative journalism”
.
>“With the incorporation of these facts, Alfred's narrative is no longer
>dependent on the story he personally tells ­­­ the novel itself is
>relating the “history of his mind.” It is also relating a larger
>history of mind. These facts lend credibility to Alfred's story and
>Alfred's story humanizes and narrates these facts. Reade is
>externalizing his imaginings of Alfred's story, his social commentary,
>and his mental accumulation of facts. [...] The real world and the
>realistic world of the novel are in dialogue with one another here,
>which creates a conversational narrative of the “history of mind.””
>
#### Emily discusses the genre and presentation of the court record:
#### does the inclusion of the diaries function in a similar or
#### different manner? What about Alfred’s annotations on Jane’s diary?
#### How does this relate to the concept of “truth” OR “reality”?
#### 
> From Hard Cash: “One day she happened to mention her diary, and say it
> was a present comfort to her, and instructive to review. Julia [...]
> asked a sight of Jane’s for a model. ‘No, dear friend,’ said Jane. ‘a
> diary should be one’s self on paper.’ “This was fortunate: it
> precluded that servile imitation, in which her sex excels even mine;
> and consequently the two records reflect two good girls, instead of
> one in two skins; and may be trusted to conduct this narrative
> forward, and relieve its monotony a little: only, of course, the
> reader must not expect to see the plot of a story carried minutely out

> reveal their true selves by glimpses only, and the gravest and most
> dramatic events give the diviner so few and faint signs of their

#### To what extent is Hard Cash critiquing discourse, language, and
#### classification systems? To what extent is it critiquing their
#### misapplication? And is it useful -- or possible -- to distinguish
#### between the two?
#### 
#### Are Hard Cash’s compilation methodology and facts making a claim

Questions of HC as a sensation novel and the oddness of the apparent
fact that “facts” don’t produce the impression of probability or
“truth.”

Absence of self-conscious meta-narrative (compared to Trollope).
