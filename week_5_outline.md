# Great Expectations (second half)

#### From Week 4: Butt and Tillotson “Dickens at Work”

Exercise on note-taking.
If Dickens was required to add “fluff” material by his editors because a segment of the serial was deemed to be too short, what implications does this have for Barthes’ “reality effect”?
How can we use records of research practices to think about how to restore serialized novels for publication in an ordinary book format? Do you use the uncut or originally published version? Does it matter?
To what extent is an editor a collaborator? What is the extent of their contributions to a serialized novel?

### Workshop - extracting character names from *The Barsetshire Chronicles*

#### Shannon Marcus, “The Female Accessory”
+ Deb’s Criticism 
> ...she explains, “this book proposes that we try to understand how [gender and sexuality] were intertwined in ways that make homosexuality and heterosexuality less than useful categories for dividing up the Victorian world,” (22).
.

> “For Victorians, femininity depended as much on homoerotic as on heteroerotic desire, and Dickens explores what that might mean for men who desired women. His novel presents an older woman’s obsessive, objectifying desire for her adopted daughter as a primal scene for the hero, who learns to equate social status and erotic desire with being a woman’s pampered, fashionable doll. The female dyad’s overt contempt for him as a working-class boy leads him to reject his male body by using fashion to become feminine-that is, to become a woman’s object of desire,” (3). 

.
> Yet, Miss Havisham’s relationship with Estella was not completely out of the ordinary, but rather “simply intensified,” and reminiscent of the conventional “mother-daughter relationship represented in fashion magazines and doll stories…” (170).

.
> Marcus describes this process “gender mobility, in which women become men and men become women” (171).

.
> Marcus mentions that such details are “far from being the gratuitous detail Barthes associated with the reality effect,” but rather, are integral to the plot for Pip’s first actions toward transformation is to buy new clothes; she also addresses Pip’s femininity in the context of history, with fashion at this point in time being more of a female pursuit (182-3). 

.
> the importance of the female-female relationship in remarking that Miss Havisham’s relationship with Estella, her use of Estella as a kind of doll, uniquely results in Estella/the doll “as an effective instrument of feminine power,” for “Estella’s feminine ‘completeness and superiority’…make[s] Pip feel inferior to her” (171).

+ Sophie’s Seminar Paper

> It is perhaps because I think that she does such a good job at pulling out details like those above, that I am also unhappy that she neglected to discuss Biddy or the original ending of Great Expectations in this chapter. She pays so much attention to detail and so it seems as though she did herself a disservice by focusing only the relationship between Miss Havisham and Estella and Pip’s desire to establish a place for himself in that relationship. While Biddy is not a member of “a female dyad” she is a woman and is set up to be Estella’s foil. 

.
> I do think that Pip wanted to marry Biddy. He was just thwarted in his attempt because she married Joe instead. It is also significant that instead of distancing himself from the masculine, Pip calls himself a “man” in his proposed proposal to Biddy. I also think that it is important that while Pip does not get married at the end of Great Expectations there is still a marriage… This seems to imply that marriage between a man and a woman is taken seriously in this novel. It is not only a “union between two fashionable women” that is desired. Joe and Biddy’s marriage shows that a marriage between equals can lead to domestic bliss. 

.
> While I agree with Marcus’ reading of Estella’s transformation and also think that, in the end, she is “drawn into a sentimental dyad with Pip”, I think that it would have benefited Marcus to look at the original ending of Great Expectations because, in my opinion, it does not have the same effect. It is certainly important to examine the text as it was published and as readers knew it. However, it is also interesting to look at the ending as Dickens originally intended it and to discuss whether or not it fits in with Marcus’ overall argument.

It is certainly important to examine the text as it was published and as readers knew it. However, it is also interesting to look at the ending as Dickens originally intended it and to discuss whether or not it fits in with Marcus’ overall argument…  In the original ending of the novel Estella does not realize for herself that any transformation has occurred in her character. It is Pip, as the narrator, who informs the reader that such a transformation has taken place. This seems to reduce the importance of Estella being “drawn into a sentimental dyad with Pip.” The inclusion of a discussion of the original ending of Great Expectations might have diminished the strength of Marcus’ argument about the new sentimental dyad formed by Pip and Estella at the end of the novel. 

.
> I also think that it is too narrow and too forced to be particularly persuasive. Marcus only described Pip’s desires as they relate to the female dyad of Miss Havisham and Estella. 

What about the two published endings: does the difference between them make a difference for this argument? [pull up in ATYR and in our edition] 

#### Elaine Freedgood, “Realism, Fetishism, and Genocide”
Timeline: novel begins 1812, slavery abolished 1833, GE written 1860-1

+ Alli’s Criticism Summary

> Freedgood draws on Marxist and Freudian definitions of a fetish in asserting that the Negro Head Tobacco that Magwitch smokes is an example of an impure commodity fetish which offers a partial knowledge of social relations present in its production rather than a complete reiteration or repression of them. The fetish is impure because its production is not abstracted; rather, it circulates with “a soothing symbolics — in this case, of racial subjugation” (33).

.
> Because this substitution hides in plain site, “the symbol becomes the object of attention and thereby of a special inattention” and isn’t read as a repression. Realism’s “low threshold of interpretability” means that “readers do not habitually or reflexively stop and ponder the meaning of Magwitch’s preferred tobacco” (37).

.
>  [I]n the same way that self-policing becomes internalized within the novel’s panopticon-esque structure, slavery and subjugation becomes embedded in the novelistic world in such an overt way that novel-readers’ suspicions aren’t aroused to incite investigation for deeper meaning. Whereas in the case of the tobacco a failure to reference the indigenous genocide would have invited a “reading into” that absence or void, making that labor and identity present — as with the “slaves” of British society — marks it and monumentalizes it in a way that can invite no further inquiry.

.
>  I think that this means that our emotional responses upon “decoding” metonymy threaten to stop at self congratulation for the act of decoding: that even today, in literary criticism, we fail to register the loss that the detail becomes substituted for. 

.
>how are we to read the Victorian novel with an awareness of the different discourses that would have been available for readers at the time to draw upon? What does it mean that for us to “notice” Negro Head Tobacco requires historical research, whereas for contemporary readers the symbolism — if not the “real,” or the deeper meaning of the detail — would have been apparent? And what does it mean if we set out on a process of de-coding if Victorian novel readers were trained, as Freedgood argues, that not all details have meaning, and therefore needn’t be decoded? Freedgood’s multiple sub-sets of metonymy don’t escape the trap of forcing the reader to distinguish between meaningful and meaningless “reality effects”, but this is at least partially historically determined. Is our goal then to read as Victorian readers would have read, or to de-code their novels to understand how they read their world?



#### Emily’s Close Reading

>“The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of light between the two­and­thirty and the Judge, linking both together, and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on, with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this way of light, the prisoner said, ‘My Lord, I have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,’ and sat down again. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say to the rest. Then, they were all formally doomed, and some of them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of having to be helped from his chair and to go very slowly; and he held my hand while the others were removed, and while the audience got up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere) and pointed down at this criminal or that, and most of all at him and me.” p. 458 ­ Volume 3 Chapter 17 ­ Chapter 56

.
> He is attempting to reveal the presence and structure of disciplinary power by juxtaposing the cruelty of the audience with the humanity of the convicted, but does not give his characters (or his readers) viable options to subvert this power.

.
> In a sense, Dickens creates a stage for the condemned and a “gallery” for the audience. He implies a social­physical divide between the two groups when he states, “the audience… pointed down at this criminal or that.” ...This language is flippant, which implies that the audience sees no higher stake in this sentencing than they would any other performance. The spectacle is “petty”, no different than “church or elsewhere”, which masks their coercive power.

.
>Throughout the novel, characters feel as though they are being watched and are wracked with terror that their wrongdoing will be discovered. As in the panopticon, they feel as though they are under constant surveillance even though they cannot say for certain that someone is watching them.

Can we compare this scene with that of Mr. Wopsle’s earlier in the novel? 
Different ways of challenging the reader and the audience of information/narrative?

.
> Dickens treats light as a symbol of a divine presence and pending justice. Pip says that a “broad shaft of light” “links” the judge and the condemned together. He says that this serves to “remind” the audience that there is no significant difference between the judge and the condemned because they would be judged with “absolute equality” after they pass on. He invokes Biblical language, saying that everyone will meet “greater Judgment that knoweth all things and cannot err.” It is all­knowing, all­powerful, and perfectly just. The current proceedings are distinct from this greater justice. Magwitch tells the judge, “My lord, I have received a sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours.” “[T]he Almighty” has sentenced Magwitch to “Death” just as He has sentenced everyone to death. Magwitch views God’s “sentence” as distinct from the judge’s sentence. He “bows” to the judge’s sentence not only because it is backed by law, but because it happens to align with God’s plan. This is not to suggest that the judge’s sentence is just. Divine justice is only possible after death and there is no guarantee that this will occur. Magwitch is portrayed as a “distinct speck of face” in “the way” of the divine “light.” This suggests that Magwitch, while standing in the light, blocks some of it from reaching the judge. The judge is “reminded” of divine justice, but does not have to face it and does not have to consider a greater justice in reaching his decisions. The light could also be seen to form a halo around Magwitch, implying a sort of divine blessing. Justice can only be achieved after death, not during life. 

Can we think about judgment & light on other characters? Miss Havisham? Pip?

My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office” (291)
