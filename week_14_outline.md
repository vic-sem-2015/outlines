#### “Finale”: Concerning Conclusions … 
> Every limit is the beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young lives after being long in company with them, and not desire to know what befell them in their after-years? For the fragments of a life, however typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises may not be kept, and an ardent outset might be followed by declension; latent powers may find their long-waited opportunity; a past error may urge a grand retrieval. 

.

> In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived, and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since it was always done by somebody else.
+ What is at stake in the representation of Fred and Mary’s authorship at the end of MM? (Elucidated by Bernstein? In opposition to or compared to Casaubon?) 

.

> On inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit Stone Court [...] and that on sunny days the two lovers who were first engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in white-haired placidity at the open window from which Mary Garth, in the days of old Peter Featherstone, had been ordered to watch out for Mr. Lydgate.

.

> Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lays outside it [...] we insignificant people with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that of the Dorothea whose story we know.  

.

> But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependant on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a human life, and rest in unvisited tombs. 

What does this ending do to our understanding of Eliot’s web? Is the Finale itself a fragment? Do we “trust” it and take it seriously? How does it compare with other conclusions we’ve seen in the course, which we’ve agreed present a particular problem for realist fiction? (What are the implications of making it a “Finale”?
In terms of hierarchical organization: how does it affect how we imagine we’re supposed to read the novel that minor characters receive Eliot’s/the narrator’s attention in this condensed return to Middlemarch?


#### Social Totalities: Theory and Practice
> This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of deceiving him: it was what he said to himself -- it was as genuinely his mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen to disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is satisfied, the more robust is our belief . (552) [add additional excerpts about ‘character theory’; the egoism speck of Casaubon ]

Let’s consider what it means to assign each individual in the novel a theory. We’ve talked about epigraphs as theories for chapters; what about characters themselves *as* theories, rather than merely holding theories? Can we discuss Dorothea in particular, in relation to Kurnick’s “Erotics of Detachment?” Is “desire” a theory characters hold, or critics? 

>”Her mind was theoretic” quote 
Dorothea as a theorist or a theory? 
Vs Celia 

>There may be coarse hypocrites who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the sake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them. He was simply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic beliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his desires in satisfactory agreement with those beliefs. 

What sort of understanding do we get of Middlemarch by exposure to the interpretation of events through the multiple theories of its characters? Is this what makes the novel feel “total”? And where would we place our experience of the narrator’s theories, like the parable of the concentric circles, within this universe? Is the narrator him/herself the controlling theory? 

Epigraph activity: select a chapter and apply the epigraph’s “theory” (20-30 mins)

##### “Webs” -- More Untangling? 

[Some models for literal mappings](https://courses.swarthmore.edu/spring2013/engl111/2013/04/08/middlemarch-relationship-map/)
How might we imagine some literal-minded modes of mapping MM? 
> “I would contend that Eliot creatively advances a social commentary about not only the obstacles women with intellectual desires encounter, but also the value of a community of knowledge seekers who work in unison rather than in isolated cells of their own” (Bernstein 132). 

.

> “Eliot and Lewes converted their London home into a club of select scholars, artists, politicians and other luminaries. Eliot highlighted the critical importance of salon culture in her 1854 *Westminster Review* essay ‘Women in France: Madame de Sable.’ Here she argued against the relative isolation of Englishwomen in their homes in contrast to french women intellectuals who benefitted from ‘being admitted to a common fund of ideas, to common objects of interest with men; and this must ever be the essential condition at once of true womanly culture and of true social well-being.’” (141)

Eliot classically defines her project as a novelist as untangling a web of social relations within the community of Middlemarch; however, whereas she gets insight into characters’ internal processes, her characters themselves are typically described as alienated or isolated: the men, by their egotism -- particularly in scholarly pursuits -- and the women, by their desires. From whose perspective, then, is the social life of Middlemarch a web? And how are its people united? -- monetary exchange? desire and marriage? familial ties? history? 
“Lifted Veil”

> Dorothea, after exposure to Casaubon’s will: “She might have compared her experience at that moment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on a new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory would not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs” (519)

> Mr. Bulstrode’s past: The terror of being judged sharpens the memory: it sends an inevitable glare over that long-unvisited past which has been habitually recalled only in general phrases. Even without memory, life is bound into one by a zone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man to own his blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened wound, a man’s past is not simply a dead history, an outworn preparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose from life: it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing shudders and bitter flavours and the tinglings of a merited shame. (Chapter LXI) 

question about the introduction of Mr. Bulstrode’s memory-- essentially, what does it mean to open up the book with this discussion of the social as a web, and then to complicate that with the past? (we might also make this section “portrayals of the past” -

#### Reading Perspectives
> “No matter; those who read the ‘Pioneer’ don’t read the ‘Trumpet,’” said Will, swallowing his tea and walking about. “Do you suppose the public reads with a view to its own conversion? We should have a witches’ brewing with a vengeance then -- ‘Mingle, mingle, mingle, mingle. You that mingle may’ -- and nobody would know which side he was going to take.” (492)

.

> Plying along his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got along, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest seas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the enemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders of the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him, the effigy of himself [...] and there had arisen apparently in the air, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of his words 

.

> The most innocent echo has an impish mockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker; and this echo was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision of a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. 

.

> “Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth -- all that is very well” -- here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke’s shoulder, as the echo said, “All that is very well;” then came a hail of eggs, chiefly aimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by chance. (535-537)

Are multiple perspectives supposed to “convert” readers -- and if so, to what? The narrator’s view? → ties into our questions of open versus controlled interpretations of Eliot 

####Temporality, Narration, and Untangling of Knotted Webbs
> From last week: “I at least have so much to do in unravelling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe.”

Unlike Walter Scott, who compares his novel to a hackney-coach and offers meta-commentary on his narrational tempo, and Charles Reade, whose division during the slower later years of *Hard Cash* is thematic rather than chronological, and Elizabeth Braddon, for whom time is a guiding hand and inevitability that will untangle the circumstances surrounding Fred’s disappearance, George Eliot’s novel seems so much more concerned with varied perspectives that she rarely reflexively comments on temporality. However, if her novel is a web, it’s still hierarchical: we receive important information about family connections and characters’ pasts -- the Bulstrodes, for instance -- much later than others. 

How do we reconcile this with the narrator’s “untangling” project? Do we view this as a question of access -- is the narration dependent on the narrator being presented with information at the same rate that we, the readers, watch events unfold? Or do we see the narrator withholding information? 

#### Eliot’s Notebooks and Research (Rachel)

##### Bernstein, “Roomscapes”
> Bernstein argues that the panoramic, round structure of the British Museum’s library, which also resembled shopping arcades, mirrored the structure of Eliot’s 1860-1862 novel: “The panoramic dimensions of the Reading Room and of Eliot’s most experimental novel might be read as part of this urban romance of the arcades, the partnerships of glass and iron arensa of large public space and the contours of Eliot’s Victorian novel, that -- like the curving shelves of the reading room -- mingled together past and present places and spaces.” (117)

> The description of Eliot’s anguished preparation for *Romola* anticipates the research preservation and writing paralysis that besets her most famous figure of a failed scholar, Edward Casaubon. (118-119)

> Bernstein discusses Eliot’s visits to the British Museum as fostering an exteriority that was of secondary preference to the interiority she craved, writing that the famed author experienced “dome consciousness” -- “a blistering blend of imagined surveillance and judgement of both her writing and her lifestyle” and “a panopticon of unwanted visibility”  (120). 

> “Almost like a textual marketplace of assorted bits of knowledge on early modern Florence, this medley of quotation and commentary on both print and anecdotal sources constitutes a toolbox of information Eliot used to construct her historical novel. Some years later, Eliot wrote about the process of converting researched notes into literature as ‘the exercise of a veracious imagination in historical picturing … using all extant evidence and supplying deficiencies by careful analogic creation.’” (126)

> “Eliot’s Proem encourages readers to interpret the novel as a commentary on ‘gender-defined sphere’ [...] I would suggest that [the frontispiece ‘The Blind Scholar and His Daughter’] highlights a rethinking of the gendered meanings of public and private spatial relationships as well as scholastic pursuits” (129)  Bernstein writes that Eliot’s descriptions of female scholars in her novels tend to depict them as careful readers, whereas males like Casaubon seem modeled on the blind figure in the frontispiece.

> “we can see her method of capturing the spirit of the age of reform as a mix of interiority -- her ‘childish’ and ‘disjointed’ memories -- and exteriority as she reads through newspaper reports.” (138)


#### (For reference): Kurnick *An Erotics of Detachment*					
> But while Middlemarch is arguably the most perfect realization of the novel’s ambition to present a historicized picture of the social whole, it is, more disturbingly, a book that seems reluctant to share these intellectual riches with its characters. 
+ Why? Also, how can we think about this in the context of the quote on the back of the Penguin edition: “People are almost always better than their neighbours think they are” and the Oxford edition: “there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it”? In other words, thinking about a character’s and a person’s limited perspective and that of the novel’s attempt to widen the perspective of its readers…

> Dorothea, it seems clear, can only lose out in any competition that pits her against her creator in a game of wits; but I want to suggest that it is as a figure for the novel-reader that Eliot’s desiring heroine functions most powerfully as an agent and pursuer of knowledge. 

> And far from endorsing my claim that desire may be fiction’s point of contact with the terrain of critical knowledge, Eliot appears instead to say that the body is the site of the novel’s closure to history and the possibility of critique (from the prelude).		

> Eliot’s multiple references to the novel here (“multi-volumed romance,” “love-stories in prose”) cement the association of that form with feminine desire and set up a paradoxical but pointed comparison between novel-sized Dorothea and the epic-sized novelist who invented her; if Dorothea’s hyper-femininity serves by contrast to excuse one famous woman (st. Theresa) from the taint of her gender, it also works to excuse another (Eliot herself) from the taint of her genre. 	
+ More questions for Rachel: Why does she use a male pseudonym? Did people know that she was a woman?

> My argument here is that this is an arbitrary point at which to terminate narrative analysis, and that we should recall that for the novel-reader, narrative consumption—far from ending with the conclusion of an individual novel—is an ongoing process, continually renewed. 
+ Do we agree? 				

> The foregoing analysis of the function of desire in the realist novel implies, more precisely, that where fiction most obviously solicits its readers’ “adolescent” fantasies is also where it encourages those readers in their most critical, even scientific, habits of mind. 	
+ Think about the “sexy stuff” in *Barchester Towers*? *Great Expectations*? Lady Audley’s Secret*? Etc.

> The desire-fueled repetition compulsion that characterizes novel consumption is precisely what qualifies this practice as a pursuit of critical consciousness, a truly pervasive and ongoing popular attempt to achieve a carnal knowledge of the contours of social reality.
