##Emily’s seminar paper						
> The novel ultimately fails to deconstruct the boundaries between text and real life, presenting the possibility of solution while frustrating readers’ attempts to find it. One such false lead are the unsigned epigraphs which appear to reference other texts and writers in the same way the attributed quotations do, but the endnote in the Penguin edition of *M​iddlemarch* ​suggests that these fragments to Eliot herself (p. 840).
	
+ Based on our understanding of the “realist project” of Victorian novels, the authors of these novels were not trying to equate the world of the text with real life; in fact, their consciousness of this disparity often appears in their novels. If this was not their project, what does it mean to “fail to deconstruct the boundaries between text and real life”? Were they trying to deconstruct these boundaries? Trollope is very explicit in claiming that the text should not be equated with real life. Is George Eliot doing the same, but much more subtly? Or is she claiming something else about the relationship between the text and real life?

> Middlemarch​ compels the reader to actively engage in socially responsible reading practices by inspiring a desire for more knowledge that can never be satisfied. 

+ Do we see this anywhere other than in the epigraphs?				

> For Kurnick, characters like Dorothea blur the lines between reader and character as they are both “pursuer[s] of knowledge.” Michal Ginsburg describes the purpose of an epigraph, stating, “The use of epigraphs establishes a relation between the text and a past tradition... [T]he result of the act of preceding the text by an epigraph is that the text defines itself in relation to a past text” (Ginsburg, p. 547). Using epigraphic references to other texts identifies the novel with this previous literary tradition. By making so many references to different works, Eliot assumes an active readership that has either already read the referenced texts or is open to finding the reference. 

+ How well read would Eliot’s readers have been?

> Mary uses literary fiction as thematic fact, stating that she “must go back on my experience” in order to give a proper answer to Fred. While this is said humorously, since her “experience” is confined to the pages of a book, she refers to a broad literary base to prove her point. Mary draws from the reader’s world in a manner in which they would recognize. 

> Eliot’s unsigned epigraphs appear to be similar to the epigraphs excerpted from other works. They are presented as poetry or excerpts from a play and do not have any more direct connection to the text than any of the other quotations. 
+ Does the plot act in concert with or work against the epigraph?
> Assuming an active readership, as Kurnick argues and Eliot supports, providing an un­referenceable reference compels the reader to pursue information that does not exist. The entire point of this action is to experience the pursuit and desire for knowledge, not to find the rest of the poem or play outside of the novel or resolve the problem by rooting its referentiality entirely within the chapter. 
+ Is Eliot adopting a different persona to write these fragments? Does it only appear so only because the reader gets so little of the play that authorial context is impossible?

> The solution lies somewhere outside or between the reader’s world and the text. There is a multiplicity of “narrative possibilities” and not only a “refusal to accept narrative closure as offering the final word”, but, also, a rejection of narrative closure as a reasonable possibility. 
As the reader searches for conclusions in their lives and other texts, they gain a greater perspective, but this perspective can never be complete. This strategy is ideal for a novel with a social project, as it provokes readers into searching for more information, making changes in an effort to reach a conclusion, and gradually conforming to the novel’s suggestions as they try to find solutions. 

+ Compare this to Reade and *Hard Cash*. There are no epigraphs and Reade seems to have different ideas about how best to get readers involved in social action. Are epigraphs different than the technical language that Reade uses? And can we think about this in the context of Schmitt and Freedgood article?

##Geoff's close reading
> A great historian, as he insisted on calling himself, who had the happiness to be to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago, and so to take his place among the colossi who huge legs our living pettiness is observed to walk under, glories in his copious marks and digressions as the least imitable part of his work, and especially in those initial chapters to the successive books of his history, where he seems to bring his arm­chair to the proscenium  and chat with us in all the lusty ease of his fine English. But Fielding lived when the days were longer (for time, like money, is measured by our needs), when summer afternoons were spacious, and the clock ticked slowly in the winter evenings. We belated historians must not linger after his example; and if we did so, it is probably that our chat would be thin and eager, as if delivered from a camp­stool in a parrot­house. I at least have so much to do in unravelling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe. (beginning of Chapter 15; p. 141) 

> While Eliot seems to be mocking Henry Fielding by writing that he “insisted on calling himself” a historian, it is clear that Eliot structures her story to be a history as well; she sets *Middlemarch*​ around forty years in the past. This is also meant to invoke, I believe, Walter Scott’s *Waverly; or, ‘Tis Sixty Years Since​.* 

+ Connections we want to make to other readings and ideas of the function of the Victorian novel?

> Fielding understood his digressions to be what set him apart from other writers— 
what made him unique.
+ What about Eliot's "digressions"? Are Eliot’s lessons in the novel, *part* of the novel? What does it mean to be *part* of the novel?

> Eliot subtly critiques Fielding’s style, imagining it as Fielding “bring[ing] his arm­chair 
to the proscenium [to] chat with us in all the lusty ease of his fine English. Eliot juxtaposes the image of a comfortable “chat” in an “arm­chair” with the image of Fielding lecturing to us from 
the stage. 

+ We’ve talked about theatricality in *Great Expectations* with the description of the court scenes (i.e. Jaggers, trial, etc.). How might we think about theatricality, now, as a metaphor with the author as actor and the novel as play?

> Of course, Eliot distinguishes herself from Fielding as well. Does Eliot sincerely believe 
that she is “living pettiness” forced to “walk under” the “huge legs” of Fielding? It is certainly a 
striking image; George Eliot’s walking under the legs of colossi is seemingly the inverse of Isaac Newton’s standing on the shoulders of giants. It suggests, I believe, the idea that innovation in literature operates much differently than scientific discovery. Eliot must defend her work from the “observation” that it is the product of “living pettiness” walking under the prestige of Fielding.

+ Potential segway for discussing Eliot and Science (i.e. telescope, microscope, Alli’s interest in Victorians and Darwin, etc.)

> Eliot contends that a shift in time—both literally and figuratively—is what separates her 
style from Fielding’s. According to Eliot, “Fielding lived when days were longer, when summer 
afternoons were spacious, and the clock ticked slower in the winter evenings.” Eliot locates the blame of her shorter days in the emerging discourses of the industrial revolution: “for time, like money, is measured by our needs.
+ What do we make of the fact that *Middlemarch* is by far the longest novel we have read this semester and Eliot’s suggestion that time is more limited in her era than in Fieldings’?

##Geoff's criticism summary of Price
> How are we to represent a text? Should we pull excerpts, or should we summarize? 
Should we weigh texts according to the amount of free­standing aphorisms  or dictums they contain? Can these excerpts capture the theme, structure, and beauty of the entire work? What separates an anthology from a review? 

> Is narrative the only part of a novel that is significant and worthy of literary criticism? Most of the authors that we have read so far would suggest that this is not the case? So why do people read? What is the impetus for reading? What do the various authors we have read think is the reason for reading a novel?

> Price discusses how the ethics of the review influenced how George Eliot’s texts were approached and qualified. 


> Price suggests that as reviewers sought to distance their practice from anthologies, they began to criticize Eliot for sacrificing organic narrative for the sake of concise, moralistic passages.


> Price draws from Eliot’s reviews to suggest that Eliot believed that the value of a work lay in the amount of passages one could excerpt from it (139). According to Price, Eliot would later incorporate this literary judgment into her own writing, structuring her novels so that there were clear pieces to be gleaned from the whole: “from the first, the experience of reviewing made [Eliot] aware that her work would be transmitted through quotation” (140). 

+ *From Emily’s seminar paper*: However, Eliot believed that fragmentation and excerpting from larger works was unfair to the author, which suggests that the epigraphs are performing a different function than merely nodding at other authors. According to Leah Price, George Eliot’s “own review had already questioned the evidentiary value of quotation” since she believe that “quotations [do not] provide a ‘fair’ specimen or ‘do justice’” to authors (Price, p. 142).	

> Price then explores the ambivalence that Victorian reviewers had in their abilities to 
represent a text through excerpts. Significant for us, I think, is Price’s discussion of “the tension between an organicist theory and a synecdochal practice” (144). An organicist theory, I believe, advocates for the ability to appreciate a narrative as a whole; on the other hand, a synecdochal practice seeks to pull out certain pieces of a text and claim that those excerpts are representative of the overall narrative. Price argues that as reviewers moved away from a synecdochal practice, they criticized Eliot for her lack of an organic narrative. To quote one reviewer, “As the number of George Eliot’s ‘wise, witty, and tender’ sayings increase, the directness with which she paints living persons diminishes” (qtd. in Price 146). Eliot’s relationship with the review is a Catch 22: While reviewers could only evaluate Eliot's work through taking excerpts from it, reviewers criticized Eliot's work for containing too many passages that they could easily excerpt. 

+ Can we put the other authors that we have read on the organicist-synecdochal spectrum?

> “In objecting to the plums which relieve the doughy stodginess of puddings, Eliot’s reviewers reversed the age­old comparison of fiction with sweetmeats and instruction with plain food” (148). In other words, whenever Eliot wrote in a moral or realistic tone, reviewers claimed she was indulging herself at the cost of her readers. As Price writes, “the anthologies [which] intended to prove Eliot’s moral and artistic rigor became instead the sign of vanity and  vulgarity” (149). An organic narrative, though fictitious, was considered more nutritious for the reader than Eliot’s humanistic sermons. 

+ What’s changed because Sophie doesn’t find them to be “preachy”?

> Thus Price ultimately suggests that the origin—and subsequent critique—of Eliot’s narrative 
style arose out of Victorian anxieties over the legitimacy of the literary critic.

##Deb's close reading

>Mr. Casaubon was touched with an unknown delight (what man would not have been?) at this childlike unrestrained ardor: he was not surprised (what lover would have been?) that he should be the object of it. …Dorothea’s faith supplied all that Mr Casaubon’s words seemed to leave unsaid: what believer sees a disturbing omission or infelicity? The text, whether of prophet or of poet, expands for whatever we can put into it, and even his bad grammar is sublime (50).

> In the first sentence, the parentheses serve the opposite function of emphasizing the text within rather than suggesting that the text within is supplementary. The parenthetical text disrupts the flow of the narrative.

+ In what other ways does Eliot play around with punctuation? Parentheticals separate parts of the text, much like Eliot’s epigraphs described in Emily’s seminar paper...

> Furthermore, the parenthetical text also highlights the unsubstantial nature of the words around it, bringing focus to something relatively more certain: the text within the parentheses characterizes, and to a certain extent, reduces Mr. Casaubon to a man (for his delight) and a lover (for his un-surprise).

> The aforementioned parentheticals with respect to Mr. Casaubon are inserted after a description of an action or more specifically, a feeling that any other man or lover would have felt in that moment; the object of delight or un-surprise comes after the parenthesis. In this part, however, the work of Dorothea’s faith does not seem as universal and stands slightly apart from the corresponding question. In other words, Dorothea’s faith provides something while the question implies noticing absence (i.e. “unsaid” and “omission”).

+ What else in the novel does Eliot ask her readers to fill in for themselves? Are there other instances of omission?

> The text is considered in terms of originating from a prophet or poet, and it is interesting to consider that the author/narrator knows what will happen (like a prophet) and guides the reader through form (whether it be diction or grammar).

> It also seems almost ironic to suggest that a text can expand through the audience given the immensity/length of Middlemarch as a novel, but it is not altogether an unfamiliar suggestion; Elaine Freedgood and Cannon Schmitt’s “Denotatively, Technically, Literally” similarly suggests the reader’s work beyond the figurative can expand the text. This statement in particular, though, warns the reader about mistaking the text for being exactly what the reader interprets it as, asking for a unique kind of separation…

##Alli's close reading 				
> This paragraph follows the reading of Mr. Featherstone’s wills and the subsequent fuss caused by the property bestowed on Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone at the beginning of Book IV: “And here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating a low subject. Historical parallels are remarkably efficient in this way. The chief objection to them is, that the diligent narrator may lack space, or (what is often the same thing) may not be able to think of them with any degree of particularity, though he may have a philosophical confidence that if known they would be illustrative. It seems an easier and shorter way to dignity, to observe that – since there never was a true story which could not be told in parables where you might put a monkey for a margrave, and vice versa – whatever has been or is to be narrated by me about low people, may be ennobled by being considered a parable; so that if any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought into view, the reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more than figuratively ungenteel, and may feel himself virtually in company with persons of some style. Thus while I tell the truth about loobies, my reader’s imagination need not be entirely excluded from an occupation with lords; and the petty sums which any bankrupt of high standing would be sorry to retire upon, may be lifted to the level of high commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition of proportional ciphers.” (Chapter 35) 
					
> However, this raises the question of why an apology for subject matter comes now: Mr. Featherstone featured as a character in the earlier books of the novel as well, and Fred Vincy and Will Ladislaw, both of whom have monetary woes, have already been introduced sympathetically at this point. 

+ Why does the apology comes at this particular moment?

> It seems thus, that when the narrator advises readers to consider her discussion of commoners a parable for a life which might, in reality, be more “ennobled” or wealthier, it’s really perhaps trying to erase some of the difference between social class, which seems to be generating anxiety for Dorthea and, at the very least, some reflection on Eliot’s part.  

+ Questions for Rachel: Do you know how Eliot felt about social class? What class was Eliot a part of?

>We might discuss whether placing readers initially on the upper story of the manor with the Brooke and Cadwallader families is a way to induce self­conscious reflection of their place in relation to the “spectacle” of those of lesser status – and if so, what relation these two chapters have to how readers approach a novel where previously, the interrelations of the various social classes has been emphasized. 

> Moreover, it’s this general applicability and adaptability – here identified with parables rather than parallelism – that allows Eliot’s story to be “ennobled” and transcend its subject matter. 
I just want to suggest a few more themes for possible exploration in discussion, the first being the narrator’s claim that substituting a monkey for a margrave does not inhibit the telling of a true story. I think this would be interesting to fit within our ongoing discussion of Darwinism within the Victorian period.				
> I think it would also be helpful to think about substitution with regards to authors’ views on truth­telling.

> We also might want to think about the language of the final sentence and the “web” that Eliot proposes to untangle for us, and the importance of economics – particularly as discussed vis a vis marriages and funerals – in creating a social world, versus imagination itself (thinking particularly of Rosamond and Lydgate and Fred’s expectations). 

##Kurnick *An Erotics of Detachment*					
> But while Middlemarch is arguably the most perfect realization of the novel’s ambition to present a historicized picture of the social whole, it is, more disturbingly, a book that seems reluctant to share these intellectual riches with its characters. 

+ Why? Also, how can we think about this in the context of the quote on the back of the Penguin edition: “People are almost always better than their neighbours think they are” and the Oxford edition: “there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it”? In other words, thinking about a character’s and a person’s limited perspective and that of the novel’s attempt to widen the perspective of its readers…

> Dorothea, it seems clear, can only lose out in any competition that pits her against her creator in a game of wits; but I want to suggest that it is as a figure for the novel-reader that Eliot’s desiring heroine functions most powerfully as an agent and pursuer of knowledge. 

> And far from endorsing my claim that desire may be fiction’s point of contact with the terrain of critical knowledge, Eliot appears instead to say that the body is the site of the novel’s closure to history and the possibility of critique (from the prelude).		

> Eliot’s multiple references to the novel here (“multi-volumed romance,” “love-stories in prose”) cement the association of that form with feminine desire and set up a paradoxical but pointed comparison between novel-sized Dorothea and the epic-sized novelist who invented her; if Dorothea’s hyper-femininity serves by contrast to excuse one famous woman (st. Theresa) from the taint of her gender, it also works to excuse another (Eliot herself) from the taint of her genre. 	

+ More questions for Rachel: Why does she use a male pseudonym? Did people know that she was a woman?

> My argument here is that this is an arbitrary point at which to terminate narrative analysis, and that we should recall that for the novel-reader, narrative consumption—far from ending with the conclusion of an individual novel—is an ongoing process, continually renewed. 
+ Do we agree? 				

> The foregoing analysis of the function of desire in the realist novel implies, more precisely, that where fiction most obviously solicits its readers’ “adolescent” fantasies is also where it encourages those readers in their most critical, even scientific, habits of mind. 
	
+ Think about the “sexy stuff” in *Barchester Towers*? *Great Expectations*? Lady Audley’s Secret*? Etc.

> The desire-fueled repetition compulsion that characterizes novel consumption is precisely what qualifies this practice as a pursuit of critical consciousness, a truly pervasive and ongoing popular attempt to achieve a carnal knowledge of the contours of social reality.
